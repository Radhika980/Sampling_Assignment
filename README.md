# Machine Learning Models

**1. Random Forest**: An ensemble model made up of multiple decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all the trees.

**2. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: A method for separating data points into different classes using a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space. It is commonly used for binary classification problems, but can also be adapted for multi-class classification.

**3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple model that classifies new data points based on the classes of their nearest neighbors in the feature space. It is commonly used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

# Sampling techniques

**1. Simple Random Sampling**: A basic sampling technique where each data point in the dataset has an equal probability of being selected in the sample.

**2. Stratified Sampling**: A sampling technique where the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic, and samples are taken from each stratum in proportion to the population.
